25,Go the Distance,Hercules,1997,"I have often dreamed of a far off place Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be  I'll be there someday, I can go the distance I will find my way if I can be strong I know every mile would be worth my while When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong  Down an unknown road to embrace my fate Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you And a thousand years would be worth the wait It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through  And I won't look back, I can go the distance And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat It's an uphill slope But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance And my journey is complete, oh yeah  But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh  Like a shooting star, I will go the distance I will search the world, I will face its harms I don't care how far, I can go the distance 'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms  I will search the world, I will face its harms 'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms"
24,I 2 I,A Goofy Movie,1995,"Hey yeah I got myself a notion One I know that you'll understand We set the world in motion By reaching out for each other's hand  Maybe we'll discover What we should have known all along One way or another Together's where we both belong  If we listen to each other's heart We'll find we're never too far apart And maybe love is the reason why For the first time ever, we're seein' it I-2-I  If a wall should come between us Too high to climb, too hard to break through I know that love will lead us And find a way to bring me to you  So don't be in a hurry Think before you count us out You don't have to worry I won't ever let you drown (Nothing's gonna stop us now)  If we listen to each other's heart We'll find we're never too far apart And maybe love is the reason why For the first time ever, we're seein' it I-2-I  Love is why we're seein' it I-2-I (Yes, we are seein' it I-2-I) Seein' it I-2 (Love is why we're seein' it) I think we're seein' it I-2-I (I-2-I) I-2-I We're seein' it I-2-I (I-2-I!)  If you're ever lonely, stop!

23,Everybody Wants to be a Cat,The Aristocats,1970,"Everybody wants to be a cat Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at Everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat 'cause everything else is obsolete  A square with a horn Makes you wish you weren't born Every time he plays But with a square in the act You can set music back To the caveman days  I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing Still a cat's the only cat Who knows how to swing Who wants to dig a long-haired gig stuff like that? When everybody wants to be a cat  A square with a horn Makes you wish you weren't born Every time he plays With a square in the act You can set music back to the caveman days  Everybody wants to be a cat Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at When playin' jazz he always has a welcome mat 'cause everybody digs a swingin' cat  Everybody, everybody Everybody wants to be a cat  Everybody, everybody Everybody wants to be a cat  Everybody, everybody Everybody wants to be a cat"

I can't believe my eyes I must be dreaming Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair What's this?  What's this? What's this? There's something very wrong What's this? These people singing songs  What's this? The streets are lined with Little creatures laughing Everybody seems so happy Have I possibly gone daffy? What is this? What's this?  There's children throwing snowballs Instead of throwing heads They're busy building toys And absolutely no one's dead  There's frost on every window Oh, I can't believe my eyes And in my bones I feel the warmth That's coming from inside  Oh, look, what's this? They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss Why that looks so unique? Inspired They're gathering around to hear a story Roasting chestnuts on a fire What's this?  What's this? In here they've got a little tree, how queer And who would ever think And why?  They're covering it with tiny little things They've got electric lights on strings And there's a smile on everyone So, now, correct me if I'm wrong  This looks like fun This looks like fun Oh, could it be I got my wish? What's this?  Oh my, what now? The children are asleep But look, there's nothing underneath No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them Or ensnare them, only little cozy things Secure inside their dreamland  What's this? The monsters are all missing And the nightmares can't be found And in their place there seems to be Good feeling all around  Instead of screams, I swear I can hear music in the air The smell of cakes and pies Are absolutely everywhere  The sights, the sounds They're everywhereand all around I've never felt so good before This empty place inside of me is filling up I simply cannot get enough  I want it, oh, I want it Oh, I want it for my own I've got to know, I've got to know What is this place that I have found? What is this?  Christmas town? Hmm"

When he was a young warthog When I was a young warthog  He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal He could clear the savannah after every meal I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind  And, oh, the shame Thought of changin' my name And I got downhearted Every time that I...
